# Currency Exchange Rate Data Engineering Project

Welcome to my currency exchange rate data engineering project! This project focuses on retrieving real-time currency exchange rates from an external API, storing the data in a PostgreSQL database, and presenting it through a PHP web page. Additionally, an automated script updates the exchange rate data every 24 hours using the Windows Task Scheduler.

## Project Overview

This project is designed to accomplish the following:

- Fetch currency exchange rates from a designated API.
- Store the retrieved data in a PostgreSQL database.
- Display the exchange rates on a user-friendly PHP web page.
- Automate the data update process using a script and Windows Task Scheduler.

## Components

The project consists of the following components:

- **Currency API**: The external API that provides the exchange rate data.
- **Data Retrieval & Storage**: This component handles fetching and storing the exchange rate data.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Where the currency exchange rate data is stored.
- **Currency Update Script**: A script responsible for updating the database with the latest exchange rates.
- **Windows Task Scheduler**: Automation tool used to run the update script at specified intervals.
- **PHP Web Page**: A simple web interface to display the stored exchange rate data.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2. Configure the necessary API access credentials in the appropriate files.
3. Set up the PostgreSQL database with the required schema.
4. Run the data retrieval and storage component to populate the database initially.
5. Set up the Windows Task Scheduler to run the currency update script at the desired interval.
6. Access the PHP web page to view the displayed exchange rate data.
